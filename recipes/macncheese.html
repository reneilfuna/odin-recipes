            <li>1/4 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
                occasionally until cooked through but firm to bite,
                around 8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium
                heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add flour, salt, and pepper, and stir until smooth, around
                5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue
                to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, 
                about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cheddar cheese and stir until melted, around 2 to 4
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot and enjoy!
