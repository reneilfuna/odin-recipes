        <p>
            Like mac and cheese? Hate the ready made or tinned options
            but are too lazy to cook? This recipe is for you! 
        </p>
        <p>
            In only 25 minutes, this easy stovetop recipe is a must try! Good news is 
            that once you've made it a couple times, you won't be able to stop!
